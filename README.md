# Creating-Currency-Converter-with-the-help-of-Tkinter-Python-GUI-
Here we are going to work on a GUI-based Currency Converter that accepts the Indian rupee as input value and converts that value to US Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Chinese Yuan, etc. when the user clicks the covert button. We will use the current exchange rate for the project. (The exchange rate is the price of one currency in term of another currency).
